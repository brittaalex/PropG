1. There is a syntax error in $ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]));
=> $ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]);

2. Use of split is discouraged. It is deprecated as per the latest PHP 5.3.1 version, preg_split() is suggested or incase of no regular expression can use explode() also.

3. $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI] => $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] => This is the actual syntax as per the PHP manual to avoid any future errors.

4. Jquery => $.get(	
    "/getinfo/111", {},
    function(data) { $('.InfoDiv').html(data); }
);
=> Unnecessary curly braces. Curly braces not necessary.
$.get(
    "/getinfo/111",
    function(data) 
	{ 
	$('.InfoDiv').html(data);
 	}
);

4. $data = new dataObj(); => This is wrong, It should be $data = new baseObj();

5. As the class file is declared as data.php it would be better if you use the same name for the class instead of baseObj.

6. $table should be declared public in base class and no need to declare private in sub class,need to only assign the tablename

7. Table condo Id should be primary key.

8. In table condo PID is INT, it should be BIGINT instead as the PID references to property table.

9. Table property engine is MyIsam, this should be INNODB as all other tables are INNODB.

10.  In all extended classes need not declare private for $table, need to just assign values
